# Breast Cancer Recurrence Prediction

## Overview

This project focuses on the fusion and classification of clinical data and mammographic images to predict Breast Cancer Recurrence. The key aspects include the collection and preprocessing of clinical data and mammographic images, the utilization and evaluation of various Machine Learning and Deep Learning models, and the development of a multi-modal tool incorporating both clinical data and mammographic images for breast cancer recurrence prediction.

## Key Features

- **Clinical Data Integration:** Collection and preprocessing of relevant clinical data for breast cancer recurrence prediction.
  
- **Mammographic Images Processing:** Preprocessing and feature extraction from mammographic images to enhance predictive modeling.

- **Model Development:** Utilization and evaluation of various Machine Learning and Deep Learning models for breast cancer recurrence prediction.

- **Multi-modal Tool:** Development of a comprehensive tool that incorporates both clinical data and mammographic images for enhanced prediction accuracy.
